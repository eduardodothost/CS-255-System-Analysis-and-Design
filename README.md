# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design Module Eight Journal


    The DriverPass Project

> The class worked their way through the various stages of system development. Completing a proposal and system design documentation for a mock client.


    Enjoying The Birds Eye View

> I enjoyed working to understand the client's problem; and helping to provide them with a vibrant solution that would add a great deal of quality and value to their current bussiness process. I feel that I did well modeling the problem and subsequent solutions. I also enjoyed presenting my findings.


    What's Next

> If I could continue here; I'd probably jump into the documentation in order to find more specifics for future deployment and implementation models.
